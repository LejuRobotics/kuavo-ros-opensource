.. warning::

    Before running any code examples, make sure to start the robot first by executing either:
    
    - For simulation: ``roslaunch humanoid_controllers load_kuavo_mujoco_sim.launch`` (Example command)
    - For real robot: ``roslaunch humanoid_controllers load_kuavo_real.launch`` (Example command)

Robot Info
===========
Examples showing how to get basic robot information.

  :language: python

End Effector Control
=====================

LejuClaw Gripper
----------------
Examples demonstrating how to control the LejuClaw gripper end effector, including position, velocity and torque control.
